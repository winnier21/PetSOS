# Project Title

PetSOS

## Overview

A mobile solution to pet first aid emergencies. By walking the users through the correct procedures on how to respond to injuries or accidents that happened to their pets, I want to give users agency when it comes to the survival outcome of their pet's emergency care needs.

### Problem

Most pet owners love their pets like family members. However, compared to other human family members, most owners donâ€™t invest the same amount of care and energy when it comes to knowing how save their pets. Its the unfortunate truth that most pet owners are not prepared for many common pet emergencies.

With these statistics, the trend is that pet owners in North American society are not prepared to provide emergency care to their pet if a life threatening situation were to happen.

### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account.

It is a solution to bridge a knowledge gap that exist in pet emergency first aid. This app tries to accomplish three things:

1. Automatically prepare a list of nearby veterinarians and calls each until answered.
2. Guides pet owners with accurate first aid instruction and procedures while waiting for veterinarian response.
3. Navigate the user towards the clinic that agreed to see the user.

### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

### APIs

List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches.

### Data

Describe your data and the relationships between them. You can show this visually using diagrams, or write it out.

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

### Auth

Does your project include any login or user profile functionality? If so, describe how authentication/authorization will be implemented.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.

## Nice-to-haves

Your project will be marked based on what you committed to in the above document. Under nice-to-haves, you can list any additional features you may complete if you have extra time, or after finishing.
